## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I have furthered my development in layout designs and the use of CSS Grid and flexbox to achieve this.

I also gained confidence  in applying psuedo selectors like 


```css
& :first-child {
    width: 75%;
  }
```

### Continued development

Further my design layout and responsive design skills with more complicated designs.
